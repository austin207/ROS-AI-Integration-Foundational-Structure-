# Domain-Specific LLM & ROS Integration Project

![Project Banner](docs/images/project_banner.png)

A full-stack research and development project that builds a large language model (LLM) from scratch on domain-specific data (covering electronics, programming, VLSI, and related topics) and then distills it into a compact small language model (SLM) for real‑time integration within a ROS (Robot Operating System) environment. This repository provides end‑to‑end code for data processing, model training, knowledge distillation, ROS integration, evaluation, and experiment tracking.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate a full cycle of building a domain-specific LLM from the ground up without using any pre-trained weights. The LLM is trained on a large corpus of technical data, and then its knowledge is distilled into a much smaller, resource-efficient SLM. Finally, the SLM is integrated as a ROS node to enable natural language command processing and real‑time robotic control. This architecture is designed for researchers and practitioners interested in:

- **Language Model Research:** Training models entirely from scratch using custom data.
- **Knowledge Distillation:** Compressing large models into efficient ones using teacher–student techniques.
- **Robotics and ROS:** Integrating AI models into robotics applications using ROS for modular, real‑time operation.

---

## Features

- **LLM Training from Scratch:**  
  Custom-built Transformer architecture trained on curated domain-specific datasets.

- **Knowledge Distillation:**  
  Teacher–student framework with custom loss functions that incorporates rationale extraction and multi-task objectives.

- **ROS Integration:**  
  A dedicated ROS package that wraps the distilled SLM for inference and provides a natural language interface for robotic tasks.

- **Data Augmentation & Preprocessing:**  
  Scripts for downloading, cleaning, tokenizing, and augmenting raw technical data.

- **Comprehensive Experiment Tracking:**  
  Experiment logs, Jupyter notebooks, and detailed reports to ensure reproducibility and facilitate performance evaluation.

- **Modular and Extensible Design:**  
  Clear folder separation for data, model training, distillation, ROS integration, evaluation, and documentation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended) or any Linux-based system.
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.
- **PyTorch:** Installed via [pip](https://pytorch.org/) or conda.
- **ROS 2:** (e.g., ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill) installed following the official [ROS 2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).
- **Additional Dependencies:** Other Python packages as specified in your requirements (e.g., `requests`, `PyYAML`, etc.).

### Data Preparation

1. **Download Raw Data:**  
   Place your raw domain-specific data (technical articles, code repositories, documentation) in the `data/raw` directory. A sample file (`sample.txt`) is provided as an example.

2. **Preprocess Data:**  
   Run the preprocessing script to tokenize, clean, and standardize the raw data:
   ```bash
   python3 src/data/preprocess.py
   ```
   This will generate processed data files in the `data/processed` folder.

3. **Data Augmentation (Optional):**  
   To augment your data synthetically, run:
   ```bash
   python3 src/data/augment.py
   ```
   Augmented outputs will be stored in `data/augmentation`.

### Model Training

1. **Configure Training:**  
   Edit the training hyperparameters in `src/llm_training/config.yaml` or override them via the global config in `config/global_config.yaml`.

2. **Train LLM from Scratch:**  
   Start the training process using the provided shell script:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/run_llm_training.sh
   ```
   Checkpoints will be saved in the `models/trained` folder.

### Knowledge Distillation

1. **Configure Distillation:**  
   Update distillation settings in `src/distillation/config.yaml` (or via `config/global_config.yaml`).

2. **Run Distillation Process:**  
   Execute the distillation script to compress the full-scale LLM into the SLM:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/run_distillation.sh
   ```
   The distilled model checkpoints will be stored in `models/distilled`.

### ROS Integration

1. **Build the ROS Package:**  
   Navigate to your ROS workspace and build the package using colcon (or catkin, if applicable):
   ```bash
   colcon build --packages-select slm_ros
   ```

2. **Source the Workspace:**  
   Source the built workspace to set up the environment:
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

3. **Deploy the ROS Node:**  
   Launch the ROS node using:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/deploy_ros.sh
   ```
   This will start the SLM node that listens on the `slm_input` topic and publishes responses on the `slm_output` topic.

---

## Usage

### Running the Training Pipeline

- **Training the LLM:**  
  Use the training script via:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/run_llm_training.sh
  ```
  Monitor logs in the console and review saved checkpoints in `models/trained`.

### Running Distillation

- **Distillation Process:**  
  Run the following command to start knowledge distillation:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/run_distillation.sh
  ```
  Checkpoints for the distilled model will be saved in `models/distilled`.

### Deploying ROS Nodes

- **Launching the ROS Integration Node:**  
  Use the deployment script to build, source, and launch the ROS package:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/deploy_ros.sh
  ```

- **Interacting with the ROS Node:**  
  Publish natural language commands to the `slm_input` topic (e.g., via `ros2 topic pub`) and observe the SLM responses on the `slm_output` topic.

### Evaluation & Experimentation

- **Evaluation Scripts:**  
  Run evaluation scripts (e.g., `src/evaluation/evaluate.py`) to assess model performance using metrics such as perplexity or task-specific accuracy.

- **Experiment Notebooks & Reports:**  
  Open the Jupyter notebooks in `experiments/notebooks` for detailed experiment documentation, view logs in `experiments/logs`, and review comprehensive reports in `experiments/reports`.
